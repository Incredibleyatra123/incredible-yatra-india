# Incredible Yatra India — Quick Start

This project is built with Next.js and Supabase. It implements a booking flow with Razorpay webhook handling and an admin dashboard.

## Non-technical quick launch (I will guide you)

1. Create Supabase project (done).
2. Run the SQL migration (done).
3. Create a GitHub repository and upload this project (or upload the ZIP to Vercel).
4. In Vercel, create a new project -> Import Git Repository or Upload ZIP.
5. Set environment variables in Vercel from .env.example.
6. Deploy. Visit /admin/login to sign in using admin credentials (run the create_admin_user.js script first on a machine with env vars set).

If you want, I will walk you step-by-step to upload the ZIP and deploy to Vercel.
